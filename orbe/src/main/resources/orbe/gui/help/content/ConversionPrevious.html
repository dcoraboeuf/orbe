		<h1>Conversion from 0.2 files</h1>
		<p>
			Files that have been created with previous versions of Orbe (1.0.4 or 1.0.3) are
			read like any other Orbe file. Just open them and they will be automatically converted.
		</p>
		<p class="Caution">
			When you save such an old file version, the old version will be overriden by
			the new format.
		</p>
		<p class="Caution">
			In current version of Orbe (2.0.0 Alpha 01), there is a problem at the reading of
			text elements. They are slighty shifted horizontally and vertically regarding to their
			old position. This should be fixed in next versions of the software.
